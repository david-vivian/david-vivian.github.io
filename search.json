    "text": "About\n\n\nI am a Visiting Assistant Professor of French Language and Culture at Soka University. A specialist in Caribbean and francophone literature, I situate much of my work within the environmental humanities. My first monograph, Decolonial Ecologies in Francophone Caribbean Literature: From Messiahs to Mangroves (under contract with Liverpool UP), develops the concept of “eco-epistemology” to explore how Caribbean authors challenge Eurocentric categories of nature, culture, and knowledge. Against the instrumentalist legacies of colonial capitalism, I read authors such as Suzanne and Aimé Césaire, Patrick Chamoiseau, Maryse Condé, Édouard Glissant, Yanick Lahens, and Gisèle Pineau to elucidate a critique of social and ecological messianism, gesturing instead toward relational and decolonial alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture taken while hiking Martinique’s volcano, Mont Pelée, January 2025"
