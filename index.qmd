## About
::: columns
:::: {.column width="65%"}
I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of French Language and Culture at Soka University. A specialist in Caribbean and francophone literature, I situate much of my work within the environmental humanities. My first monograph, _Decolonial Ecologies in Francophone Caribbean Literature: From Messiahs to Mangroves_ (under contract with Liverpool UP), develops the concept of “eco-epistemology” to explore how Caribbean authors challenge Eurocentric categories of nature, culture, and knowledge. Against the instrumentalist legacies of colonial capitalism, I read authors such as Suzanne and Aimé Césaire, Patrick Chamoiseau, Maryse Condé, Édouard Glissant, Yanick Lahens, and Gisèle Pineau to elucidate a critique of social and ecological messianism, instead pointing the way to relational and decolonial alternatives.

## Teaching {.section-title}

I am committed to student-centered teaching in my language and culture courses, helping cultivate vital skills at a time when education is actively under assault. With extensive teaching experience at both liberal arts colleges (Skidmore College; Soka University) and research universities (UC Santa Barbara; Paris-VIII), I foster inclusive classrooms where students connect language learning to critical issues, such as the climate crisis, social justice, and learning in the age of AI.
